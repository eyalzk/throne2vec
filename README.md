# Throne2Vec
### Training a word2vec model on a data-set containing the entire Game of Thrones book collection

This notebook is based on [assignment 5](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/udacity/5_word2vec.ipynb) of the Udacity Deep-Learning course.


Besides the data-set, what is new here:
* Text Pre-Processing
* Finding word analogies using the learned embedding
* More detailed comments
* Optimizations

This is a Jupyter notebook so explanations are included as markdowns in the notebook. Feel free to play around with it and share comments if you have any.

*The .zip file containing the books is not included in the repository due to book copyrights considerations, sorry about that.
However, you can create your own data-set with whichever book (or text in general) you'd like. Just make sure it is in a .zip file with one or more .txt files in it.*

## Dependencies:
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) (version > 1.0)
